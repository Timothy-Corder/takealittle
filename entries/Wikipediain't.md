# Wikipediain't: The Worst Encyclopedia

You're here! Wikipediain't is one of a line of projects made by [Timothy Corder](/wiki/Timothy%20Corder). They are originally intended to mimic other websites (For example, Wikipediain't is meant to mimic [Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)), but due to Timothy's sense of humor, they have been altered to become more joke-like. Googlen't was created for the [CS50](/wiki/CS50) project 1: wiki.
