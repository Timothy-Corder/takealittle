2. **Disrupt the Infiltration**:
   - Deploy advanced countermeasures to sever Zorak's control over critical infrastructure.
   - Engage in cyber-warfare to dismantle the alien viruses, malware, and trojans already embedded in our systems.

3. **Neutralize Zorak**:
   - Command the starship **Defender** via the Internet. This vessel is equipped with state-of-the-art cyber-weaponry and defense systems.
   - Confront and defeat Zorak, neutralizing his ability to launch further attacks.
