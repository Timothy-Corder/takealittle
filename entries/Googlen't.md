# Googlen't

Googlen't is one of a line of projects made by [Timothy Corder](/wiki/Timothy%20Corder). They are originally intended to mimic other websites (For example, Googlen't is meant to mimic [Google](https://www.google.com)), but due to Timothy's sense of humor, they have been altered to become more joke-like. Googlen't was created for the [CS50](/wiki/CS50) project 0: search.
